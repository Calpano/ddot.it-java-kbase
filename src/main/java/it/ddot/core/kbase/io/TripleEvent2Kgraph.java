/**
 * Adds each {@link IDdotEvent} to a {@link Kgraph} as the real subject→predicate→object edge it represents.
 * <p>
 * Node identity is by id == text: the subject, predicate and object nodes are created (or reused) with their text as
 * id, so {@code Constant} pattern queries hit the SPO index. The label defaults to the id but may be set separately in
 * advanced ddot.it; labels are allowed to collide.
 * <p>
 * The triple's source location (resource + line) is recorded on the edge for provenance, and the triple's own metadata
 * ({@link IDdotEvent#meta()}, e.g. {@code ,, ..since.. 2025}) is folded into the edge's {@code data} JSON, one key per
 * relation, so it is queryable and readable via {@link Kedge#meta()}.
